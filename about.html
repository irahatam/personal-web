          <h1>Hallo, Ich heiÃŸe Matahari.</h1>
          <p class="p-about">
            I study computer science and design at NYU, but you've probably
            already read that in my homepage. I enjoy driving and singing in my
            car, traveling, dancing, playing musical instruments, and exploring
            Target. Don't ask me what day it is because I probably have no idea.
            In case you were wondering, I don't really speak German, it just
            sounded cool to say that.

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that technology and design are inseparable, because
          everything new originates with a creative thought. I love to integrate
          technology and design to ideate and generate creative concepts to
          solve problems. The users are always my first thought when it comes to
          designing.
