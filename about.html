        <h1>Hallo, Ich hei√üe Matahari.</h1>
        <p class="p-about">
          I study computer science and design at NYU, but you've probably
          already read that in my homepage. I enjoy driving and singing in my
          car, traveling, dancing, playing musical instruments, and exploring
          Target. Don't ask me what day it is because I probably have no idea.
          In case you were wondering, I don't really speak German, it just
          sounded cool to say that.

      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that technology and design are inseparable, because everything
        new originates with a creative thought. I love to integrate technology
        and design to ideate and generate creative concepts to solve problems.
