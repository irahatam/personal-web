            <h4>Watchmen Podcast</h4>
            <p>
              After listening to the Watchmen podcast, not only that I learned
              the behind-the-scenes of the Watchmen series, I got new insights
              to how I should think about and proceed with my senior project. I
              especially liked the way Lindelof took inputs from the directorâ€™s
              (Nicole Kaselle) POV as someone who hasnâ€™t read the OG Watchmen
              comics. Although Lindolf is a screenwriter and a comic book
              writer, he needs Kaselleâ€™s POV as the director of the first two
              episodes to share her thoughts on how a TV audience (who also
              mightâ€™ve not read the comics) would understand the storyline. I
              think this technique is also important for my final project. Other
              than my needs as a UX designer to conduct a user testing of the
              app to make sure it flows perfectly, I also need a fresh set of
              eyes to make sure that Iâ€™m not limiting myself to certain things
              when developing my project. The other thing that Lindelof did was
              when he was brainstorming, he came up with a list of adjectives to
              describe the Watchmen comics to solidify what he wants the TV show
              to be. I also did this for my Independent Study, it was kind of
              hard thinking about the adjectives but it gave me a sense of where
              I want (and donâ€™t want) my project to be. Lastly, Lindelof said
              that he took inspiration from his own life to develop the story.
              This could be useful for me because if I make the project
              personal, it would be easier for me to come up with ideas and
              inspirations.

              Inputs for my projects: 
              <ul>
                <li>User research/customer
                    insights is very important to my project. The user always comes
                    first, I donâ€™t want to build an app that I like but I want to
                    build an app that the user likes and needs</li>
                <li>My life and experiences</li>
                <li>Websites such as dribbble and behance</li>
